<h1 id="openterminalhere">Open Terminal Here</h1>

<p>AppleScript application which opens a Terminal at the location of the front-most Finder window</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The application is well suited to be placed in the Finder&#8217;s toolbar.</p>

<p>Clicking it opens a new Terminal window and changes directory to the location of the selected file/folder. Drag and dropping items on the icon opens one Terminal window per item.</p>

<p>Holding down the ⌘ key opens tabs instead of windows.</p>

<p>Holding down the ⌥ key changes directory in the front-most Terminal window instead of opening a new one. When the frontmost window is busy it opens a new window/tab (depending on the state of the ⌘ key)</p>

<h2 id="todo">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Find a better way to open a new tab in Leopard&#8217;s Terminal</li>
<li>Correctly handle the case when both ⌥ and ⌘ are pressed. The code is ready for this but it currently produces a strange behavior. This is probably related to the System Events call. Fixing the point above should therefore fix this one</li>
<li>Improve AppleScript code (use lists, less for loops, more functions, etc.)</li>
<li>Remove identical paths when dropping several items on the application, so that only one shell is open per unique path</li>
<li>Improve the icon so that it can be used at &#8220;Small Size&#8221; (not sure if it&#8217;s possible)</li>
<li>When this is ran while Terminal is not already running, an additional Terminal is opened. Suppress this.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="historyoftheoriginalscript">History of the original script</h1>

<ul>
<li>30-OCT-2001: Version 1.0, adapted from one of the example toolbar scripts</li>
<li>30-OCT-2001: Now handles embedded single quote characters in file names</li>
<li>30-OCT-2001: Now handles folders on volumes other than the startup volume</li>
<li>30-OCT-2001: Now handles click on icon in top-level (machine) window</li>
<li>31-OCT-2001: Now displays a nicer terminal window title, courtesy of Alain Content</li>
<li>11-NOV-2001: Now folders within application packages (.app directories) and has a new icon</li>
<li>12-NOV-2001: New properties to set terminal columns and rows as the Terminal does not use default settings</li>
<li>14-NOV-2001: Major change, now handles 8-bit characters in all shells, and quotes and spaces in tcsh</li>
<li>18-NOV-2001: Version 1.1: Rewrite, now uses a temporary file ~/.OpenTerminalHere to communicate the directory name between AppleScript and the shell because this is much more reliable for 8-bit characters</li>
<li>16-JAN-2006: Version 2.0: Rewrite, now uses &#8220;quoted form of&#8221; and &#8220;POSIX Path&#8221;. This gets rid of Perl and temp files, but it no longer handles files instead of folders.</li>
<li>24-JAN-2007: Version 2.1: Integrated enhancements by Stephan Hradek, can again handle dropped files.</li>
<li>18-NOV-2007: Leopard Update. Detects busy tab and opens a new one if needed - Jonathan Austin</li>
